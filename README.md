# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

Just select the day and year you want to view and switch to the corresponding branch: `git checkout year-day`

Alle puzzles are programmed in Rust. To run them use the provided VSCode Dev Container und execute `cargo run`. This will execute against the main puzzle input.
To run against the example input use for the first few puzzles `cargo run -- --test` and for the later ones `cargo test`.
